# Attend
An app that can keep track of users presence. 
There are two ways to submit a presence: with a QR Code and with a geolocation. 

## 1. Serve the app
Browser: `ionic serve`
Andoird emulator: `ionic cap run android -l --external`

## 2. Register your presence
To submit the form and register your presence you need to provide your firstname, lastname and signature. Depending on which mode the app is in, you also need to scan a QR code which contains the string&nbsp;&nbsp;`Presence detected!`. You can generate this QR code with any tool online or print the one provided in the root of the project (`qrcode.png`). 

## 3. Password
The password to get into the admin page of the app is&nbsp;&nbsp;`BlijfInUwKot`
